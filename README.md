## Network
![UWCNN-SD](D:\wsc\毕业论文\期刊论文\UWCNN\论文\最终版上传论文\JOE_TIF插图\fig. 1.tif)
## Usage
### Requirements
matlab

python = 3.6

tensorflow =1.9.0

numpy = 1.14.3

cv2 = 3.4.1.15

### Testing
1. Clone the repo
2. Put the test underwater images into the "Inputs" folder
3. Run main.m in the "DCT" folder
4. Run test.py
5. Find enhanced results in the "Outputs" folder
### The enhanced results of [U45](https://github.com/IPNUISTlegal/underwater-test-dataset-U45-) dataset by proposed method is in the folder "result_U45".
