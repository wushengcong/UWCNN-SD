The trained model of the paper [S. Wu, T. Luo, G. Jiang, M. Yu, H. Xu, Z. Zhu and Y. Song, "A Two-Stage Underwater Enhancement Network Based on Structure Decomposition and Characteristics of Underwater Imaging," IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, doi: 10.1109/JOE.2021.3064093](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9423872).
## Usage
### Requirements
python = 3.6

tensorflow =1.9.0

numpy = 1.14.3

opencv-python = 3.4.1.15
### Testing
1. Clone the repo
2. Put the test underwater images into the "Inputs" folder
3. Run main.m in the "DCT" folder
4. Run test.py
5. Find enhanced results in the "Outputs" folder
### The enhanced results of U45 dataset by proposed method is in the folder "result_U45".
